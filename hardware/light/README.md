# ESP32 Setup

## Flashing

To set up audio recording + playback on the ESP32 (M5 Atom), do the following:

1. Open Arduino IDE, and open the [client.ino](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/software/source/clients/esp32/src/client/client.ino) file
2. Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, search "esp32", then install the boards by Arduino and Espressif
3. Go to Tools -> Manage Libraries, then install the following:

- M5Atom by M5Stack [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/m5atom/)
- WebSockets by Markus Sattler [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/websockets/)
- AsyncTCP by dvarrel [Reference](https://github.com/dvarrel/AsyncTCP)
- ESPAsyncWebServer by lacamera [Reference](https://github.com/lacamera/ESPAsyncWebServer)

Finally, to flash the .ino to the board, connect the board to the USB port, select the port from the dropdown on the IDE, then select the M5Atom board (or M5Stack-ATOM if you have that). Click on upload to flash the board.

### Alternative - PlatformIO

You don't need anything, PlatformIO will install everything for you, dependencies, tool chains, etc.

Please install first [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) open source ecosystem for IoT development compatible with **Arduino** IDE and its command line tools (Windows, MacOs and Linux), and then enter to the firmware directory:

```bash
cd software/source/clients/esp32/src/client/
```

And build and upload the firmware with a simple command:

```bash
pio run --target upload
```

## Wifi

The board needs to connect to WiFi. Once you flash, connect to the ESP32 WiFi portal "01-Light" which will get WiFi details. Once it connects, it will ask you to enter 01OS server address. Once its able to connect, you can use the device.
