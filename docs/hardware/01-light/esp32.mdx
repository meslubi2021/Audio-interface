To set up the ESP32 for use with 01, follow this guide to install the firmware:

1. Download [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Get the firmware by copying the contents of [client.ino](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/software/source/clients/esp32/src/client/client.ino) from the 01 repository.
3. Open Arduino IDE and paste the client.ino contents.
4. Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, search "esp32", then install the boards by Arduino and Espressif.
5. Go to Tools -> Manage Libraries, then install the following:

- M5Atom by M5Stack [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/m5atom/)
- WebSockets by Markus Sattler [Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/websockets/)
- AsyncTCP by dvarrel [Reference](https://github.com/dvarrel/AsyncTCP)
- ESPAsyncWebServer by lacamera [Reference](https://github.com/lacamera/ESPAsyncWebServer)

6. To flash the .ino to the board, connect the board to the USB port, select the port from the dropdown on the IDE, then select the M5Atom board (or M5Stack-ATOM if you have that). Click on upload to flash the board.
